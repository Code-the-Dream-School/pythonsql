In a lesson4 branch, create a program assignment-4.py.  Add
code to perform each of the operations in sql1.txt and sql2.txt.
Each of the parts should be done in a separate session.  Be sure
that you verify that your code does what you think it does, by
using the convenience print utilities.   In the case of write
operations, you commit the changes, retrieve the changed records,
and print them out.  All read and write operations should be 
performed with the ORM.
