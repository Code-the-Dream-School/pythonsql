This lesson does not introduce new content.  Instead, you are
asked to use the SQLAlchemy ORM more intensively than before.
You will need to refer to the cheatsheet.  You may ask an AI questions
to help you, but do not let it write the code for you!

At this time, review the supplemental content in
[Database Locking](./lesson-on-locking.md).  You need to understand
the issues around locking and isolation.
